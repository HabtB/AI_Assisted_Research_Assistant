# Research Assistant - Error Log & Solutions

## Date: 2025-07-13

### Issue 1: Backend Server Won't Start - Syntax Error in academic_fetcher.py

**Problem:**
- Running `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001` failed with syntax error
- Error: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` in `academic_fetcher.py` line 403

**Root Cause:**
- Invalid Python code was mixed into the `academic_fetcher.py` file
- Line 403 had: `fetcher.export_results(papers_df.head(10), "references.bib", format="bibtex") - how should modify my current code so it is displayed the way this code does; as opposed to having only research list?`
- Additional TypeScript/JavaScript code and comments were accidentally pasted into the Python file

**Solution:**
- Fixed line 403 by removing the invalid comment/question text
- Cleaned up the file to contain only valid Python code
- Removed all non-Python content that was accidentally mixed in

**Prevention:**
- Always validate Python syntax before running the server
- Keep code files clean and avoid mixing different languages
- Use proper comment syntax (`#` for Python comments)

### Issue 2: Missing Dependencies - pandas not installed

**Problem:**
- After fixing syntax error, server failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'`
- The `academic_fetcher.py` imports pandas but it wasn't in the virtual environment

**Root Cause:**
- pandas was imported in the code but not listed in requirements.txt
- Virtual environment was missing required dependencies

**Solution:**
- Added pandas to the project dependencies
- Ran `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages
- Ensured virtual environment was properly activated

**Prevention:**
- Always keep requirements.txt updated with all imported packages
- Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing new packages
- Verify all imports have corresponding entries in requirements.txt

### Issue 3: Virtual Environment Activation Problems

**Problem:**
- Commands kept failing with "No module named uvicorn" even after installation
- Virtual environment wasn't staying activated between commands

**Root Cause:**
- Virtual environment activation wasn't persistent across different command executions
- Running commands from different directories without proper venv activation

**Solution:**
- Always activate virtual environment before running Python commands
- Use full path to venv python executable when needed: `..\..\venv\Scripts\python.exe`
- Ensure commands are run from the correct directory with venv activated

**Prevention:**
- Always verify venv is activated (check for `(venv)` in prompt)
- Use consistent directory structure and activation commands
- Document the exact command sequence that works

### Issue 4: Database Schema Mismatch (Previous Issue - Reference)

**Problem:**
- 500 errors when trying to list research
- SQLAlchemy models had fields that didn't exist in PostgreSQL database

**Root Cause:**
- Database schema was out of sync with SQLAlchemy models
- Missing columns: doi, citation_count, full_content, scraped_at

**Solution:**
- Updated Alembic migration file to add missing columns and indexes
- Ran database migrations to sync schema

**Prevention:**
- Always run migrations after model changes
- Keep database schema in sync with code models
- Test database operations after schema changes

## Working Command Sequence

1. **Navigate to project root:**
   ```
   cd c:\Users\hbmek\Documents\Pursuit\AI-Projects\Research-Assistant
   ```

2. **Activate virtual environment:**
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. **Navigate to Backend directory:**
   ```
   cd Backend
   ```

4. **Run the server:**
   ```
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
   ```

## Key Learnings

1. **Always validate syntax** before running servers
2. **Keep requirements.txt updated** with all dependencies
3. **Maintain clean separation** between different file types/languages
4. **Document working command sequences** for consistent execution
5. **Use proper virtual environment activation** for all Python operations

### Issue 5: Import Error - Wrong Class Name

**Problem:**
- Server failed with `ImportError: cannot import name 'AcademicFetcher' from 'app.services.academic_fetcher'`
- Code was trying to import `AcademicFetcher` but the actual class name is `EnhancedAcademicFetcher`

**Root Cause:**
- Mismatch between import statement and actual class name in the file
- The class was renamed to `EnhancedAcademicFetcher` but imports weren't updated

**Solution:**
- Updated import in `research_tasks.py` from `AcademicFetcher` to `EnhancedAcademicFetcher`
- Updated class instantiation from `AcademicFetcher()` to `EnhancedAcademicFetcher()`

**Prevention:**
- Always update all references when renaming classes
- Use IDE refactoring tools when possible
- Search codebase for all occurrences of old class names

## Next Steps

- [ ] Verify server starts successfully
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Check frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Validate database operations
