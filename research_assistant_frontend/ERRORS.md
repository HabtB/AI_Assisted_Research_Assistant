# Error Log: Research Assistant Frontend

## 1. Linter/TypeScript Errors in `src/App.tsx` - FIXED ✅

**Original Errors:**
- Module '"./types/api"' has no exported member 'ResearchStatus'.
- 'ResearchStatus' is defined but never used.
- 'result' is of type 'unknown'.
- Parameter 'research' implicitly has an 'any' type.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added missing type definitions to `src/types/api.ts`
- Removed unused `ResearchStatus` import from App.tsx
- Added proper type casting for `result` as `ResearchCreateResponse`
- Added explicit typing for `research` parameter as `ResearchSummary`

## 2. Missing Type Definitions - FIXED ✅

**Issue:** Types were defined in `test.ts` but imported from `api.ts`
**Fix:** Moved all type definitions to `src/types/api.ts`

## 3. Import Path Issues - FIXED ✅

**Issue:** `researchApi` was imported from non-existent `../services/research`
**Fix:** Updated import path to `../types/research`

## 4. Runtime Error - MISSING DEPENDENCY ❌

**Error:** Failed to resolve import "axios" from "src/types/api.ts". Does the file exist?
**Issue:** The axios package is not installed in the frontend project
**Fix Needed:** Install axios package

**Command to fix:**
```bash
npm install axios --prefix research_assistant_frontend
```

## 5. Remaining Issues to Address

### In `src/hooks/useResearch.ts`:
- Property 'status' does not exist on type 'Query<ResearchStatusResponse, Error, ResearchStatusResponse, (string | number | null)[]>'

### In `src/types/api.ts`:
- Parameter 'config' implicitly has an 'any' type
- Parameter 'error' implicitly has an 'any' type
- Parameter 'response' implicitly has an 'any' type
- Unexpected any. Specify a different type

## 6. Import Path Fix - researchApi in useResearch.ts ✅

**Issue:**
- `researchApi` was imported from a non-existent '../services/research'.

**Fix:**
- Changed import to '../types/research' in `src/hooks/useResearch.ts`.

## 7. New Linter Errors (to review):
- 'ResearchRequest' is a type and must be imported using a type-only import when 'verbatimModuleSyntax' is enabled. (useResearch.ts)
- Property 'status' does not exist on type 'Query<ResearchStatusResponse, Error, ResearchStatusResponse, (string | number | null)[]>'. (useResearch.ts)

## [DATE] TypeScript Enum and Type Export Error in api.ts

### Error
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/types/api.ts' does not provide an export named 'ResearchCreateResponse'
```

### Cause
- TypeScript `enum` syntax is not allowed due to the project's linter/build configuration (`erasableSyntaxOnly` enabled), causing the file to fail compilation and not export the expected types at runtime.
- TypeScript interfaces and enums are erased at runtime, so importing them incorrectly or in JS files can cause runtime errors.

### Fix
- Replaced `enum` declarations with union types for `ResearchStatus` and `SourceType`.
- Changed `TaskInfo.task_info` from `any` to `unknown` to satisfy linter rules.
- Ensured all type-only imports use `import type` syntax in consuming files.

## [DATE] Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode' in App.tsx

### Error
```
Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'.
```

### Cause
- The custom hooks `useResearchStatus` and `useResearchList` used `useQuery` without specifying the expected data type, so TypeScript defaulted the returned data to `unknown`.
- When this data was used in JSX in App.tsx, React expected a `ReactNode`, but received `unknown`, causing a type error.

### Fix
- Explicitly specified the generic type for `useQuery` in both hooks:
  - `useQuery<ResearchStatusResponse>(...)` for `useResearchStatus`
  - `useQuery<ResearchListResponse>(...)` for `useResearchList`
- This ensures the returned data is correctly typed and can be safely used in React components.
